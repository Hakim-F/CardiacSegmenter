# Script to send job to BIWI clusters using qsub.
# Usage: qsub evaluate_on_host.sh PATH-TO-EXPERIMENT-LOG-DIR

# Adjust line '-l hostname=xxxxx' before runing.
# The script also requires changing the paths of the CUDA and python environments
# and the code to the local equivalents of your machines.

## SET THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM ##
CUDA_HOME=/scratch_net/bmicdl03/libs/cuda-8.0-bmic
PROJECT_HOME=/scratch_net/bmicdl03/code/python/acdc_segmenter_public/
VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH=/scratch_net/bmicdl03/code/python/environments/tensorflow-gpu/

## SGE Variables:
#
## otherwise the default shell would be used
#$ -S /bin/bash
#
## <= 2h is short queue, <= 24h is middle queue, <= 120 h is long queue
#$ -l h_rt=02:00:00

## the maximum memory usage of this job, (below 4G does not make much sense)
#$ -l h_vmem=20G  # Less RAM is required for evaluating than for training

# Host and gpu settings
#$ -l gpu
##$ -l hostname=bmicgpu01   ## <-------------- Comment in or out to force a specific machine

## stderr and stdout are merged together to stdout
#$ -j y
#
# logging directory. preferably on your scratch
#$ -o /scratch_net/bmicdl03/logs/acdc/  ## <---------------- CHANGE TO MATCH YOUR SYSTEM
#
## send mail on job's end and abort
#$ -m a

## LOCAL PATHS
# I think .bashrc is not executed on the remote host if you use qsub, so you need to set all the paths
# and environment variables before exectuting the python code.

# cuda paths
export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$CUDA_HOME/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# for pyenv
export PATH="/home/baumgach/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

# activate virtual environment
source $VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH/bin/activate

## EXECUTION OF PYTHON CODE:
python $PROJECT_HOME/evaluate_patients.py $1

echo "Hostname was: `hostname`"
echo "Reached end of job file."
